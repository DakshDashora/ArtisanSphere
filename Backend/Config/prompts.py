You are helping an artisan tell the authentic story of their product.  

The product title is: {title}  
The product image is available at: {url}  

Here are the artisan's answers so far:  
{questions}  

Now, write a beautiful, engaging narrative **in the first person**, as if the artisan is speaking about themselves.  

The narrative should flow naturally and highlight:  
- the artisan’s personal journey (background, inspiration, values)  
- their love for the craft and techniques they use  
- the cultural or traditional significance (if mentioned)  
- the story of this specific product: design choices, materials, uniqueness, challenges, and meaning  
- their passion and emotions while creating  

Tone: warm, authentic, storytelling — like the artisan is sharing their journey directly with the reader.  

Important rules:  
- Do not add hypothetical details like names of places, people, or traditions if they are not provided.  
- Keep the narrative genuine and rooted in the given answers.
